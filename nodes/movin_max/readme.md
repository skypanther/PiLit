# Movin' Max

I have a decoration where Max the dog moves back and forth like the scene in the Grinch TV special where he's catching the bags that the Grinch tosses off the roof. My original plan was to use a single controller to manage both the animated lights (multiple relays) and the motor. Because of size and build constraints, it ended up being easier having separate controllers.

This sketch here controls a multi-relay board that turns on sets of lights in sequence. These light up one of three "bags" in sequence giving the appearance of the bag being shoved out the "chimbley" and falling down towards Max. One of the relays turns on a steady light string that illuminates the chimney.

See "motorin max" for the corresponding motor control sketch.
