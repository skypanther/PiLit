# PiLit GUI

This is a React app for generating light show sequences for the PiLit system.

- `npm start` — This will start a development server running this app, which you can access at `http://localhost:1234`.
- `npm run build` — This will output a production build in the `dist` directory.

## Custom port

You can use the `-p` flag to specify a port for development. To do this, run `npm start` with an additional flag:

```
npm start -- -p 3000
```
